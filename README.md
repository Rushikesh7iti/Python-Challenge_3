# Python-Challenge_3
Performance Analyzer Of University Students
A university wants to analyze student performance based on internal assessment marks.

Marks are stored in a list, and the system must process them one by one to determine performances.

Basic Python concepts used:

for loop

list

string

conditional statements

Restrictions

1.No advanced data structures

2.No built-in shortcuts like:

max()

min()

sum()

Problem Statement

Takes N student marks as input and stores them in a list

Uses a for loop to processing each mark
Classification Rules
Marks Range	Category
90 – 100	Excellent
75 – 89	Very Good
60 – 74	Good
40 – 59	Average
0 – 39	Fail
< 0 or > 100	Invalid

Additional Requirements
The program must also

Count Total Valid Students

Count Total Failed Students

Display a Final analysis
